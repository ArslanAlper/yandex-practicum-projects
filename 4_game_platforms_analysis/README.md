## Project description

In this project, we worked for an online store, which sells video games all over the world. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales were available from open sources. We needed to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This would allow us to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns.

In front of us is data going back to 2016. Let’s imagine that it’s December 2016 and we’re planning a campaign for 2017.

(The important thing is to get experience working with data. It doesn't really matter whether we're forecasting 2017 sales based on data from 2016 or 2027 sales based on data from 2026.)

The dataset contains the abbreviation ESRB. The Entertainment Software Rating Board evaluates a game's content and assigns an age rating such as Teen or Mature.
