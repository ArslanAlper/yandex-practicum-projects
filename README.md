# yandex-practicum-projects

In this repository, I have shared my jupyter notebook projects which I made while I was learning data science at the Data Scientist Professional Training Course provided by Practicum by Yandex.

  <tr>
      <td><b>Analysis of Borrowers' Defaulting Risk</b></td>
    <td>Finding out if a customer’s marital status and number of children have an impact on whether they will default on a loan. The bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness. The aim of this report is to make an analysis for building a credit score used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.</td>

  <tr>
    <td><b>Vehicles Price Analysis</b></td>
    <td>Detailed analysis to determine which factors influence the price of a vehicle using data collected over the last few years.</td>
    <td><i>pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot</i></td>    
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td><b>Telecom Plan Analysis</b></td>
    <td>The telecom company offers its clients two prepaid plans. The commercial department wants to know which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget. It was carried out that a preliminary analysis of the plans based on a relatively small client selection. This project is to analyze clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan brings in more revenue.</td>
    <td><i>pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, scipy.stats</i></td>

  <tr>
    <td><b>Game Platforms Analysis</b></td>
    <td>Based on the historical data on game sales, it has been identified patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not in order to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns.</td>
    <td><i>pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot, scipy.stats</i></td>    
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td><b>Taxi Order Analysis Based On Wather Information</b></td>
    <td>The task is to find patterns in the available information, to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides.
It will be studied a database, analyzed data from competitors, and tested a hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency.</td>
    <td><i>SQL, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib.pylot, scipy.stats</i></td>

  <tr>
    <td><b>Customer Behavior Analysis and Plan Recommendation using Machine Learning Classification for a Telecom Operator</b></td>
    <td>For this classification task, we need to develop a model that will pick the right plan. Since we’ve already performed the data preprocessing step, we were able to move straight to creating the model. The aim is with this project to develop a model with the highest possible accuracy. In this project, the threshold for accuracy is 0.75.</td>
    <td><i>scikit learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot</i></td>    
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td><b>Prediction using Supervised Learning whether a customer will leave the bank soon</b></td>
    <td>We needed to predict whether a customer will leave the bank soon. We have the data on clients’ past behavior and termination of contracts with the bank.
We have builded a model with the maximum possible F1 score. We needed an F1 score of at least 0.59 to pass the project requirements. Additionally, we have measured the AUC-ROC metric and compared it with the F1.</td>
    <td><i>sklearn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot</i></td>    
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td><b>Finding the best place for a new oil well</b></td>
    <td>We have data on oil samples from three regions. Parameters of each oil well in the region are already known. We have builded a model that will help to pick the region with the highest profit margin. We have analyzde potential profit and risks using the Bootstrapping technique.</td>
    <td><i>sklearn, scipy.stats, pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn</i></td>
