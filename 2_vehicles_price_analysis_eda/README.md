In this project, I made a detailed analysis to determine which factors influence the price of a vehicle. We studied data collected over the last few years.


## Description of the data

- The dataset contains the following parameters:

**price**

**model_year**

**model**

**condition**

**cylinders**

**fuel** — gas, diesel, etc.

**odometer** — the vehicle's mileage when the ad was published

**transmission**

**paint_color**

**is_4wd** — whether the vehicle has 4-wheel drive (Boolean type)

**date_posted** — the date the ad was published

**days_listed** — from publication to removal
